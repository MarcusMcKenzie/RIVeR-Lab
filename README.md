# RIVeR-Lab

Toyota's Human Support Robot was built with the goal of assisting the disabled and elderly wthin home. Our uses for the robot consist of fetching, cleaning up and storing objects around a room. This consists of developing perception, navigation, manipulation and speech recognition algorithms using the various sensors of the HSR. These algorithms were developed, in part for Toyota's HSR challenges, in which we compete with other top robotics universities around the world, to use the robot to perform various actions.
